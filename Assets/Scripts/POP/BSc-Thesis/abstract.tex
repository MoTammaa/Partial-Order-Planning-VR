\ac{AI} is rapidly gaining importance and, thus, it is being increasingly integrated into our daily lives. One of the classical problems in \ac{AI} is the problem of planning which is an essential problem in \ac{AI} due to its applications in many fields. A highly popular planning algorithms is the \ac{POP} algorithm. The \ac{POP} algorithm is a powerful algorithm that can solve complex planning problems. Although the \ac{POP} algorithm is powerful, it can be difficult to understand for new learners. In this thesis, we present a \ac{VR} game-like environment that visualizes the \ac{POP} algorithm. The \ac{VR} environment provides a visual representation of the algorithm that aims to help new learners understand the algorithm better. Upon the evaluation of the system by conducting experiments on users to aid their learning experience, the results showed early positive feedback and signs of success.
