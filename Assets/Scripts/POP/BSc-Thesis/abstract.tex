\ac{AI} is gaining more and more importance in our daily lives. One of the classical problems in \ac{AI} is the problem of planning which is an essential problem in \ac{AI} due to its applications in many fields. One of the most popular planning algorithms is the \ac{POP} algorithm. The \ac{POP} algorithm is a powerful algorithm that can solve complex planning problems. Although the \ac{POP} algorithm is powerful, it can be difficult to understand for students. In this thesis, we present a \ac{VR} game-like environment that visualizes the \ac{POP} algorithm. The \ac{VR} environment provides a visual representation of the algorithm that aims to help students understand the algorithm better. Then, we tested the effectiveness of the \ac{VR} environment in helping students understand the \ac{POP} algorithm. The results showed positive feedback from the users.
